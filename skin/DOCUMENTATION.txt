makefiles/:
contains makefiles and files to generate makefiles

CPMskin-settings.js:
describes the settings used in the simulation, such as nr of cells, burnin time, runtime, and information about the visualization

CPMskin-template.js:
describes the parameters used in the simulation

Makefile:
first Makefile, used for a lot of testing, not relevant

comparison_final_D.make:
another makefile for testing, not relevant

epidermis0.html:
the browser-version of te simulations, currently does not work with chemotaxis

epidermis0.js:
the node-version for the simulation, this should be run for the simulations. It's parameters are:
runtime, default: 1000 (#MCS in the simulation)
savetime, default: 0 (set to 0, this will not generate images, otherwise, every "savetime" frames)
field_size, default: 200 (size of the field)
chemotaxis, default: 0 (chemotaxis strength)
infectionStart, default: 0.1 (infection radius from the middle of the field, as a percentage of the field size)
entryBias, default: 0 (0 for random entry, 1 for biased entry)
killingTime, default: 15 (killing time, can be any positive integer, 15-60 make most sense)
simulationType, default: 1 (behavior at infection, 1 for sensitive, 2 for arresting, and 3 for motile)
infectionChance, default: 0.000025 (every timestep, every skin cell has an "infection chance"*"interface length with infected cells" probability to get infected)
maxAct, default: 20 (maxAct parameter in Act model)
lAct, default: 1000 (lambdaAct parameter in Act model)
borderingparameter, default: 2 (interface length with infected cells should be at least "borderingparameter"/3 of average interface length before behavior changes)
idnr, default: 0 (idnr of the simulation, to allow multiple videos of similar simulation being made at the same time)

simulation-tissue:
this is where a lot of the simulation happens
